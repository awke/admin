Hope you are well. As you are probably aware your site has been steadily
growing in it's usage of disk space and bandwidth traffic. For instance
last month you used 1.43GB & July was 1.24GB and disk space has been
increased once a month for the last two months. These are consistantly
above the amounts which AWKE accounts come with as standard.";}s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1221507376;}s:7:"creator";s:12:"Peter Knight";s:11:"last_change";a:7:{s:4:"date";i:1221507376;s:2:"ip";s:11:"91.84.60.92";s:4:"type";s:1:"C";s:2:"id";s:31:"users_over_disk_space_bandwidth";s:4:"user";s:5:"peter";s:3:"sum";s:7:"created";s:5:"extra";s:0:"";}}s:10:"persistent";a:3:{s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1221507376;}s:7:"creator";s:12:"Peter Knight";s:11:"last_change";a:7:{s:4:"date";i:1221507376;s:2:"ip";s:11:"91.84.60.92";s:4:"type";s:1:"C";s:2:"id";s:31:"users_over_disk_space_bandwidth";s:4:"user";s:5:"peter";s:3:"sum";s:7:"created";s:5:"extra";s:0:"";}}}
