Ive done it already.
</p>

<p>
You go to internet bs choose transfer domain .com enter domain name, go
through and pay.
</p>

<p>
Then you need to get the EPP Auth Code from ukhosts.
</p>

<p>
Go into internetbs website admin, click domain and It will ask for the
code. if not I think there is a warning field where you enter the code.
</p>

<p>
ukhosts are legally obliged to providde the EPP auth code within so many
days (cant remember how long)
