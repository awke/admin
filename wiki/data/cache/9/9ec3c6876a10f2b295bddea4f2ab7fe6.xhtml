====== Customer Loyalty System

</p>

<h1><a name="section" id="section"></a></h1>

<p>

In order to grow the business we need to introduce a customer loyaly system.
</p>

<p>
First thoughts on it:
</p>

<p>
We offer each customer the opportunity to earn upto a years free standard web hosting package. For each new customer introduced to AWKE will credit the customer with £2.50 up to a maximum of 12 per year.
</p>

<p>
We could think about giving the new customer who joins a credit of £2.50 as a bonus as well so that both people benefit.
</p>

<p>
Questions:
</p>

<p>
What are the draw backs other than potentially losing £30? Although in theory we would have gained £360!
What small print do we have to have?
How would we record the information?
</p>

<p>
Please add thoughts
