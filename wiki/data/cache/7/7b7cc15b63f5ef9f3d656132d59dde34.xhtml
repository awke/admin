All,
</p>

<p>
Just had Sue Groom call me with a problem that here mail client got
disconnected when trying to get new mail (<acronym title="Post Office Protocol 3">POP3</acronym>).  I had a look in the log
file and it says
</p>

<p>
dovecot: pop3(sue@art2murals.com): Error: Message ordering changed
unexpectedly (msg #1: storage seq 666 â†’ 1)
dovecot: pop3(sue@art2murals.com): Fatal: Can&#039;t finish <acronym title="Post Office Protocol 3">POP3</acronym> UIDL command
</p>

<p>
the quick and dirty fix is to delete the dovecot-uidlist file from every
subfolder including index but it will force the client to redownload the
mailbox
</p>

<p>
I think in sues case its because the imap &amp; pop3 uid lists are so
different in date when merged it wasnt happy.  (courier used separate
lists for impa &amp;pop3 but dovecot seems to use a combined).
</p>

<p>
The email is now in /Data/email/&lt;DOMAIN&gt;/&lt;ACCOUNT&gt;
</p>

<p>
cd to this location and type find . -iname dovecot-uidlist you can then
delete them.
</p>

<p>
