All,

Just had Sue Groom call me with a problem that here mail client got
disconnected when trying to get new mail (POP3).  I had a look in the log
file and it says

dovecot: pop3(sue@art2murals.com): Error: Message ordering changed
unexpectedly (msg #1: storage seq 666 -> 1)
dovecot: pop3(sue@art2murals.com): Fatal: Can't finish POP3 UIDL command


the quick and dirty fix is to delete the dovecot-uidlist file from every
subfolder including index but it will force the client to redownload the
mailbox

I think in sues case its because the imap & pop3 uid lists are so
different in date when merged it wasnt happy.  (courier used separate
lists for impa &pop3 but dovecot seems to use a combined).

The email is now in /Data/email/<DOMAIN>/<ACCOUNT>

cd to this location and type find . -iname dovecot-uidlist you can then
delete them.

Simon
