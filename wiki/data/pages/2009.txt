2. Review of Previous Year
  * The biggest thing has been the changing of the way that customers are charged and making the billing year from February.
  * There are more scrupts in use which has allowed for the automation of domain reminders and invoicing. There reminders for those who haven't paid their invoices which are being sent out.
  * We have lost the US machine due to Bitfolk closing their US server.
  * REDK decided using us for their site and encouraging their customers to use AWKE, as a result we have lost several accounts as a result.
  * We now have our own SSL certifcate for 62 months.

3.   Financial Accounts
  * The accounts as of today are £642.13 minus the AGM expenses. This means that we have enough money to cover the hosting bill in September.
  * There are £800+ money outstanding, and some issues appear to exist from customers which will require SIMON/PETER to sort out.
  * Update: during the course of the meeting several payments were received!



4. Review of how the new invoice system worked
  * On the whole the new invoice system was a success and has saved Peter a considerable amount of work.
  * It should provide far accurate results in future (there were only three mistakes as opposed to the usual mistakes made by a manual process).
  * Also doing the domain renewals which is providing more accurate renewals and sends the information to UKHOSTS.
  * Simon has requested that when there is some spare money that this should be used to help recompense him for the time taken to write the new system. It was agreed by Ben and Peter that a sum of £100.



5. Look at number of Users:
  * We are losing them (see above)
  * Referral scheme was discussed. ACTION: Peter to further work on.


6. Review the Jump VPS
  * This was looked and a discussion took place. The final decision is that Ben is going to talk to James (Jump) about this. There would be work to move the data about the servers and setup.


7. Upgrading packages on server:
  * 13 packagess need upgrading on the server. Need to move from old stable to new stable. Question whether it is necessary if we are going to move boxes. Discussion over what they are and what the risk is. The final decision was to only upgrade the keyring at the moment and to review packages as they go forward. Action Ben - to read documentation before doing the upgrades.


8. Terms and Conditions/Acceptable User Policy
