Instructions from http://wiki.shopify.com/DNS


OK I have done this for knighthawkdelivery.com (and added the steps
below so you can do them for yourself on the other domains)

YOU WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THE LAST STEP ( Enter the domain name(s) you'll
be using in Shopify ) as I cannot do this for you

Goto awke admin site https://secure.awke.co.uk/admin

login

click the domain

then on the list of options click edit next to "DNS Record Management"

then depending upon which entry to change ( I would recommend www )
click edit

change RR [type]  from A to CNAME
change content from 212.13.216.213 to knighthawkdelivery.myshopify.com
click submit

This will change the info on our server within a couple of minutes (It
could take upto 48hrs for the rest of the internet to see it depending
upon when it cached things and propogation delays etc to finish)

There should be no need for a forwarding traffic to CNAME record.

Then the instructions on http://wiki.shopify.com/DNS say to


    *  Enter the domain name(s) you'll be using in Shopify

After that is done you will now need to add shop.widgets.com or
www.widgets.com to your claimed addresses in the DNS & Domains area of
your Shopify admin under Preferences. All requests which make it to our
servers with the domains you claimed will be routed to your shop. If you
don't complete this step, your domain will just point to a Shopify page
claiming that it cannot find the shop you are looking for.

Click "Add a domain you already own", Enter the host name, and click
Claim this hostname.

You may want to make that entry your Primary domain. To do this, click
"make this my primary domain".

Once done correctly it should look like this:
