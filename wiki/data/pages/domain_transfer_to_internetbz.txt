Ive done it already.

You go to internet bs choose transfer domain .com enter domain name, go
through and pay.

Then you need to get the EPP Auth Code from ukhosts.

Go into internetbs website admin, click domain and It will ask for the
code. if not I think there is a warning field where you enter the code.

ukhosts are legally obliged to providde the EPP auth code within so many
days (cant remember how long)
