====== HOW TO REDIRECT APACHE FROM DOMAIN TO WWW.DOMAIN ======


===== Code needed in apachextraconf =====


ServerAlias bartrams.net

RewriteEngine on

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^bartrams\.net

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.bartrams.net/$1 [R=permanent,L]





First line lets server answer for bartrams.net
the next lines rewrite bartrams.net/<JUNK> to www.bartrams.net/<JUNK>

I honestly not sure they wanted the last part I recon they probably were only interested in the first part.
