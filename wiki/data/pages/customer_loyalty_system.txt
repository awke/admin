====== Customer Loyalty System
 ======

In order to grow the business we need to introduce a customer loyaly system.

First thoughts on it:

We offer each customer the opportunity to earn upto a years free standard web hosting package. For each new customer introduced to AWKE will credit the customer with £2.50 up to a maximum of 12 per year.

We could think about giving the new customer who joins a credit of £2.50 as a bonus as well so that both people benefit.

Questions:

What are the draw backs other than potentially losing £30? Although in theory we would have gained £360!
What small print do we have to have?
How would we record the information?

Please add thoughts
