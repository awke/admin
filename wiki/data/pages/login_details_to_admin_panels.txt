often left in top mode, so you can see total of data transferred & disk ops since boot

Help lists commands
Console - tells you whats going on
shutdown - shuts the server down
shutdown force - only if the above doesn't work
boot - starts server again, typing console again will let you see it (hopefully) rebooting
if shutdown force doesn't work then contact James.
