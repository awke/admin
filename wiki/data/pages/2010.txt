====== **Minutes of Meeting** ======

Meeting took place on Sunday 17th January 2010 @ 19.36

===== 1. NEW SERVERS =====

We have three new servers, plus backup space. These will replace the Bitfolk server in due course. Backup server isn't currently working correctly, there are issues relating to the configuaration.

a) THETA SERVER: the replacement is nearly ready, just needs some final checks and tests to make sure that nothing has been missed. Data has been synced on and off.
  * Ben tried to remove a language from the server after which a discussion on which packages existed on the server. Nothing was touched!
  * Some accounts have been removed from the new system, these are ones which have become deactiveated or not paid etc.
  * Ben's domain has been changed over.
  * The file systems have been changed over to EXT3. As a result the commands for resizing diskspace have changed. 
  * There is still quite a lot of diskspace available from Jump. 17Gb unallocated and 37GB in a spare partitican.
  * Bandwidth changes from Gb used, to 95% peak.
  * £30 for 20Gb per year of additional space with Jump should be need it.
  * Move to take place either Thursday 21st Jan. New DNS settings are ns.awke.co.uk, ns1.awke.co.uk, ns2.awke.co.uk - customers who manage their own DNS settings will need to update them. Advertise one of the backup MX in advance. 
  * //**ACTION:**// Peter to send an email to customers ASAP to let customers know about the downtime and changes. Estimated downtime to be no longer than 2 hours.
  * We will need to check that the server is going to be working in terms of sending customer emails etc.
  * Debian 5.0.3 in 64bit is currently what is installed on the server.

b) ETA SERVER: Hosted with XenVZ in the UK, maybe in Maidenhead data centre. They are very cheap. Nagios server is installed on this server. It is a high spec machine. It is also running it's own Apache server, so that if there was a requirement we could temporarily run websites for us, if required. It has a panel interface available. 

c) ZETA SERVER: Hosted in the US. Now owned by Comfort Host. No panel interface available. LiteHttp Demon, Config Files, Spam Assasin, and a few other bits. This is for backup MMX. Any email sent to ALL@AWKE.CO.UK will expand out to the system. Add the option to do the same with admin@awke.co.uk.


===== 2) REQUEST TRACKER: =====
 Discussion around the configuration and usage of the package. All agreed that it was a really useful system and made a difference.
**//ACTION//** Simon: it would be good to automatically create tickets for diskspace, domain renewals etc to help with tracking.



===== 3) CUSTOMER PACKAGES =====
  * Secure Hosting: We will continue as is.
  * Email only: To get same disk space as below.
  * Standard Package: Currently have a number of medium packages which is roughly double that of standard in terms of disk space. Unlimited Bandwidth *Fair user policy on the page which sets out that it should not exceed our "UNLIMITED BANDWIDTH - nominally 5GB per month, but as long as between customers we do not exceed arranged service traffic we will not pass the charge". "HARD DISK SPACE: Upto 1GB is available per customer allocated in 100Mb chunks." Decision around the space is: We will allocate the space manually but the email will now go to request tracker instead, within that email it would include a URL to increase the space. Logic is that it is a one time URL. 
**//ACTION://** Email to go out about package increase and invoices.

**//ACTION://** Adjust packages on the admin interface for invoices - by 30th January.


===== 4) DOMAINS =====
  * Flix is sixty domain needs to be deleted.
  * //**ACTION**//: When deactivated by web interface change the package to deactivated on the domain automatically.

===== 5) LEGAL STATUS =====

  * Discussion over what we should do with the legal status of AWKE.
  * Operating Costs (approx) = £300 Jump, £50 Eta, £50 Zeta, £50 Backup = £450
  * Current Amount in the account is £810.10
  * Approximately 20 customers.
